      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Infectious Nerve was founded by a group of friends who are kind of tired in all the ways we have seen things we love & hate portrayed and reviewed. Feeling like we couldn't really find a place that did everything we wanted it to do, what else could we do by try and create a community and location ourselves.</p>
      <p>That being said, take a look around and seed if you find something you like. Get Infected, Infect others, and help create the best online enviorment the world has ever seen</p>
